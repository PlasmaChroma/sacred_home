**Sacred Home Foundation** 

**Conflict of Interest Policy** 

**Article I – Purpose** 

The purpose of this Conflict of Interest Policy is to protect the interests of the Sacred Home Foundation when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer, director, key employee, or any disqualified person as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. This policy is intended to supplement, not replace, applicable state and federal laws governing conflicts of interest. 

**Article II – Definitions** 

1\. **Interested Person** 

Any director, officer, member of a committee with board-delegated powers, or key employee who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person. 

2\. **Financial Interest** 

A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly: 

● An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Foundation has a transaction or arrangement 

● A compensation arrangement with the Foundation or with any entity with which the Foundation has a transaction or arrangement 

● A potential ownership, investment, or compensation interest with any entity involved in a transaction or arrangement with the Foundation 

“Compensation” includes direct and indirect remuneration, gifts, or favors that are substantial in nature.  
A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A conflict exists only when the Board determines that a financial interest may influence decision-making. 

**Article III – Duty to Disclose** 

In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and all material facts to the Board of Directors or appropriate committee. 

**Article IV – Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists** 

After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, the interested person shall leave the meeting while the conflict is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists. 

**Article V – Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest** 

1\. The Chair of the Board may appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement. 

2\. After exercising due diligence, the Board shall determine whether the Foundation can obtain a more advantageous arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest. 

3\. If a more advantageous arrangement is not reasonably attainable under circumstances not producing a conflict, the Board may approve the transaction if it determines that the arrangement is in the Foundation’s best interest and fair and reasonable. 

4\. An interested board member may not vote on any matter in which they have a conflict. 

**Article VI – Violations of the Policy** 

If the Board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall: 

● Inform the member of the basis for such belief and allow an opportunity to explain 

● If, after hearing the response, the Board determines that the member has failed to disclose a conflict, it may take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action, which may include removal from the board or committee 

**Article VII – Records of Proceedings** 

The minutes of Board and committee meetings with delegated powers shall include:  
● Names of the persons who disclosed or were found to have a conflict ● The nature of the financial interest 

● Any action taken to determine whether a conflict was present 

● The Board’s or committee’s decision as to whether a conflict existed ● Names of directors present for the discussion and vote 

● The content of the discussion and any alternatives considered 

● A record of the vote(s) taken 

**Article VIII – Compensation** 

● A director who receives compensation from the Foundation, directly or indirectly, is precluded from voting on matters relating to their own compensation. 

● No officer or director who receives compensation may vote on any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters. 

**Article IX – Annual Statements** 

Each director, officer, and key employee shall annually sign a statement affirming that they: ● Have received and read the Conflict of Interest Policy 

● Agree to comply with the policy 

● Understand that the Foundation is a charitable organization and must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes 

**Article X – Periodic Reviews** 

Periodic reviews will be conducted to ensure that the Foundation: 

● Operates consistently with its charitable purposes 

● Does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status ● Follows reasonable compensation and contract practices  
**Article XI – Use of Outside Experts** 

The Foundation may use outside advisors or experts when conducting reviews or evaluating transactions. Use of such experts does not relieve the Board of its responsibility to ensure appropriate oversight. 

**18\. Dissolution Clause** 

Upon dissolution of the Sacred Home Foundation, assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or distributed to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose.
